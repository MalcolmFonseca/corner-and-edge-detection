# Corner and Edge Detection

This was made as part of an assignment for my Artificial Intelligence II course at Western University. It implements Gaussian smoothing, Sobel edge detection, Gaussian derivative edge detection and Harris corner detection using manual convolutions in Python. This was a good learning experience for understanding image processing.
